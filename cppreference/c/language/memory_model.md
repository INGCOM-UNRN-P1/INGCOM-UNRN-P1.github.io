Defines the semantics of computer memory storage for the purpose of the C abstract machine. 

The data storage (memory) available to a C program is one or more contiguous sequences of _bytes_. Each byte in memory has a unique _address_.

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=c/language/memory_model&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Byte")] Byte

A _byte_ is the smallest addressable unit of memory. It is defined as a contiguous sequence of bits, large enough to hold any member of the _basic execution character set_ ([the 96 characters](translation_phases.html "c/language/translation phases") that are required to be single-byte). C supports bytes of sizes 8 bits and greater. 

The [types](types.html "c/language/types") char, unsigned char, and signed char use one byte for both storage and [value representation](object.html "c/language/object"). The number of bits in a byte is accessible as [CHAR_BIT](../types/limits.html "c/types/limits"). 

For use of bytes to representation values of other fundamental types (including big-endian and little-endian memory layouts), see [object representation](object.html#Object_representation "c/language/object")

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=c/language/memory_model&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Memory location")] Memory location

A _memory location_ is 

  * an object of [scalar type](compatible_type.html#Type_groups "c/language/type") (arithmetic type, pointer type, enumeration type) 
  * or the largest contiguous sequence of [bit-fields](bit_field.html "c/language/bit field") of non-zero length 


    
    
    struct S
    {
        char a;     // memory location #1
        int b : 5;  // memory location #2
        int c : 11, // memory location #2 (continued)
              : 0,
            d : 8;  // memory location #3
        struct
        {
            int ee : 8; // memory location #4
        } e;
    } obj; // The object 'obj' consists of 4 separate memory locations

###  Threads and data races

A thread of execution is a flow of control within a program that begins with the invocation of a top-level function by [thrd_create](../thread/thrd_create.html "c/thread/thrd create") or other means. Any thread can potentially access any object in the program (objects with automatic and thread-local [storage duration](storage_class_specifiers.html "c/language/storage duration") may still be accessed by another thread through a pointer). Different threads of execution are always allowed to access (read and modify) different _memory locations_ concurrently, with no interference and no synchronization requirements. (note that it is not safe to concurrently update two non-atomic bit-fields in the same structure if all members declared between them are also (non-zero-length) bit-fields, no matter what the sizes of those intervening bit-fields happen to be) When an [evaluation](eval_order.html "c/language/eval order") of an expression writes to a memory location and another evaluation reads or modifies the same memory location, the expressions are said to _conflict_. A program that has two conflicting evaluations has a _data race_ unless either 

  * both conflicting evaluations are [atomic operations](atomic.html "c/language/atomic")
  * one of the conflicting evaluations _happens-before_ another (see [memory_order](../atomic/memory_order.html "c/atomic/memory order")) 

If a data race occurs, the behavior of the program is undefined.  (in particular, [mtx_unlock](../thread/mtx_unlock.html "c/thread/mtx unlock") is _synchronized-with_ , and therefore, _happens-before_ [mtx_lock](../thread/mtx_lock.html "c/thread/mtx lock") of the same mutex by another thread, which makes it possible to use mutex locks to guard against data races) | | This section is incomplete  
Reason: small example or two

###  Memory order

When a thread reads a value from a memory location, it may see the initial value, the value written in the same thread, or the value written in another thread. See [memory_order](../atomic/memory_order.html "c/atomic/memory order") for details on the order in which writes made from threads become visible to other threads. 

(since C11)

Every [object](object.html "c/language/object") in C exists, has a constant address, retains its last-stored value (except when the value is indeterminate), and, for VLA, retains its size(since C99) over a portion of program execution known as this object's _lifetime_. 

For the objects that are declared with automatic, static, and thread storage duration, lifetime equals their [storage duration](storage_class_specifiers.html "c/language/storage duration") (note the difference between non-VLA and VLA automatic storage duration). 

For the objects with allocated storage duration, the lifetime begins when the allocation function returns (including the return from [realloc](../memory/realloc.html "c/memory/realloc")) and ends when the [realloc](../memory/realloc.html "c/memory/realloc") or deallocation function is called. Note that since allocated objects have no [declared type](object.html "c/language/object"), the type of the lvalue expression first used to access this object becomes its [effective type](object.html "c/language/object"). 

Accessing an object outside of its lifetime is undefined behavior. 
    
    
    int* foo(void) {
        int a = 17; // a has automatic storage duration
        return &a;
    }  // lifetime of a ends
    int main(void) {
        int* p = foo(); // p points to an object past lifetime ("dangling pointer")
        int n = *p; // undefined behavior
    }

A pointer to an object (or one past the object) whose lifetime ended has indeterminate value. 

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=c/language/lifetime&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Temporary lifetime")] Temporary lifetime

Struct and union objects with array members (either direct or members of nested struct/union members) that are designated by [non-lvalue expressions](value_category.html "c/language/value category"), have _temporary lifetime_. Temporary lifetime begins when the expression that refers to such object is evaluated and ends at the next [sequence point](eval_order.html "c/language/eval order")(until C11)when the containing full expression or full declarator ends(since C11). 

Any attempt to modify an object with temporary lifetime results in undefined behavior. 
    
    
    struct T { double a[4]; };
    struct T f(void) { return (struct T){3.15}; }
    double g1(double* x) { return *x; }
    void g2(double* x) { *x = 1.0; }
    int main(void)
    {
        double d = g1(f().a); // C99: UB access to a[0] in g1 whose lifetime ended
                              //      at the sequence point at the start of g1
                              // C11: OK, d is 3.15
        g2(f().a); // C99: UB modification of a[0] whose lifetime ended at the sequence point
                   // C11: UB attempt to modify a temporary object
    }

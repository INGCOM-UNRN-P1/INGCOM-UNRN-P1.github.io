Defined in header `[`<threads.h>`](../header/threads.html "c/header/threads")` |  |   
---|---|---  
void tss_delete( [tss_t](../thread.html) tss_id ); |  |  (since C11)  
| |   
  
Destroys the thread-specific storage identified by `tss_id`. 

The destructor, if one was registered by [tss_create](tss_create.html "c/thread/tss create"), is not called (they are only called at thread exit, either by [thrd_exit](thrd_exit.html "c/thread/thrd exit") or by returning from the thread function), it is the responsibility of the programmer to ensure that every thread that is aware of `tss_id` performed all necessary cleanup, before the call to `tss_delete` is made. 

If `tss_delete` is called while another thread is executing destructors for `tss_id`, it's unspecified whether this changes the number of invocations to the associated destructor. 

If `tss_delete` is called while the calling thread is executing destructors, then the destructor associated with `tss_id` will not be executed again on this thread.

### [[edit](https://en.cppreference.com/mwiki/index.php?title=c/thread/tss_delete&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Notes")] Notes

The POSIX equivalent of this function is [`pthread_key_delete`](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/pthread_key_delete.html). 

The reason `tss_delete` never calls destructors is that the destructors (called at thread exit) are normally intended to be executed by the same thread that originally set the value (via [tss_set](tss_set.html "c/thread/tss set")) that the destructor will be dealing with, and may even rely on the values of that or other thread-specific data as seen by that thread. The thread executing `tss_delete` has no access to other threads' TSS. Even if it were possible to call the destructor for each thread's own value associated with `tss_id`, `tss_delete` would have to synchronize with every thread if only to examine whether the value of this TSS in that thread is null (destructors are only called against non-null values).
